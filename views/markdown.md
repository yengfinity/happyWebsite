Markdown is a markup language (confusing, I know) meant to make formatting text super easy to read, easy to write, and easy to share. HTML-style rich text markup can be written in a plain text editor like vim or Sublime, so compatitbility is never an issue. It's also really simple and quick to do with little to memorize and no angle brackets to type.

Did you know?: a lot of wikis, such as GitHub's wikis use Markdown.

So lets learn Markdown!
